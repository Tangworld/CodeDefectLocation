+        <para>The Javac task does special handling of source files that 
+        can interfere with ajc.  It removes any files that are not out-of-date
+        with respect to the corresponding .class files.  But ajc requires all 
+        source files, since an aspect may affect a source file that is not out
+        of date.  (For a solution to this, see the <literal>build.compiler.clean</literal>
+        property described below.)  Conversely, developers sometimes specify a source directory 
+        to javac, and let it search for files for types it cannot find.
+        AspectJ will not do this kind of searching under the source directory
+        (since the programmer needs to control which sources are affected).
+        (Don't confuse the source directory used by Javac with the source root
+        used by ajc; if you specify a source root to ajc, it will compile
+        any source file under that source root (without exception or filtering).)
+        To replace source dir searching in Javac, use an Ant filter to specify
+        the source files.
